Time Machine File System is a read-only virtual filesystem which helps you to
read your Apple's time machine backup.

It's actually not perfect, feel free to report bugs at https://github.com/babali/tmfs/issues

Enjoy!


How to use it ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First you have to mount your HFS partition, by doing something like:
mount /dev/sdXX /mnt/hfs-root

then do as root:

tmfs /mnt/hfs-root /mnt/tm-root -ouid=$(id -u my_user),gid=$(id -g my_user),allow_other

then as a normal user do, go to the directory /mnt/tm-root/ and enjoy your data! :-)

Internals
~~~~~~~~~

Time Machine structure :

${hfs_root}/Backups.backupdb/$comp_name/${date}/${disk_name}/ <- snapshot root
${hfs_root}/Backups.backupdb/$comp_name/${date}/${disk_name}/.../File => hardlink count = node_id
${hfs_root}/.HFS+ Private Directory Data/dir_${node_id}/File <- real data

Our representation :

/${comp_name}/${date}/${disk_name}/${Real root}
